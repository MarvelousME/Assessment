# Assessment
This code is an assessment I just done, the application is very vague but a nice concept of using your experience to showcase your skills.

# ASP.Net MVC Assessment - "Phonebook"

I tried and cover as much as I could in terms of my skill and experience so that the application is extendable, adaptable and maintainable which 
just the way I live to code in that mindset.

## Built With

* Visual Studio 2019 - Developing Environment
* ASP.NET Framework with MVC Pattern (v.5) - Web Framework
* Entity Framework (v.6.0.0) - Object Relational Mapping Framework (Code First)
* IIS Express - Local Web Server (integrated by default on Visual Studio)
* [Material Dashboard](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-dashboard) - Just for that great look and feel
* ASP.NET WEB API
* LocalDB (.mdf)) (integrated by default on Visual Studio)
* Wanted to containerize it but my machine give me grief and could not load any Docker images.
* IoC Container - Autofac
* N-Layered application design
* Repository Pattern used Data Access (Generic Repository) via Service Layer
* Unit Of Work used to commit transactions to the database
* Grid.MVC for the grid to display the data
* Dependency Injection for loose coupling was enforced
* SignalR was used for real time broadcasting
* JQuery and some frontend frameworks I also made use of
* Log4Net as a logging framework for extra measure
